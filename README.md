# Final Project

## Description

This project involves building three servers: DNS, HTTP, and an HTTP redirect server. The DNS server listens for DNS requests and returns the IP address of the requested domain. The HTTP server serves files requested by clients over HTTP. The HTTP redirect server listens for incoming connections and redirects them to the HTTP server.
