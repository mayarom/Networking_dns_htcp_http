# Final Project

The purpose of this project is to create three servers: a DNS server, an HTTP server, and an HTTP redirect server. The DNS server is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses, the HTTP server serves static content to clients, and the HTTP redirect server forwards clients to the appropriate server based on the requested URL.
